# orbitalthebox python package

## Short description
A package for using orbital parameters to carry out various irradiance calculations for Earth. Beta version. A release version is coming, which will also have a jupyter notebook tutorial.

## Install
You can install (or upgrade) the package in your python environment using the `pip` terminal command (you may need to [install](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) `git` first):

If the install has been successul then you should be able to import the package in python in the usual way, e.g.:
