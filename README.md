Irradiance calculations for Earth. Beta version. A release version is coming, which will also have a jupyter notebook to introduce the various functions and what can be done with them.

The GPL license is permissive so I guess you can just republish everything under a new name without contacting me first, but I'd prefer if you didn't.
